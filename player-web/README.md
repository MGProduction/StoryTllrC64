# Web (wasm) version

The Web version (as the Linux&Windows one) needs resources (cartrdige and images) as header file

A WebAssembly build environment is required. You can download it (for Windows) here: [wasm-env](https://github.com/mattiasgustavsson/dos-like/releases/tag/wasm-env). Unzip it so that the wasm folder in the zip file is at your repository root.

The wasm build environment is a compact distribution of node, clang/wasm-ld, WAjic and wasm system libraries.
